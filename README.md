# Vite + React Project

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the Vite + React project locally.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (>= 18.x)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Using npm:
```sh
npm install
```
Using yarn:
```sh
yarn install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server
Using npm:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Using yarn:
```sh
yarn dev
```
This will start a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173/`.

### 4. Build the Project
To create a production build, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
This will generate an optimized `dist/` folder.

### 5. Preview the Production Build
After building, preview the app locally:
```sh
npm run preview
```
This will serve the built files on a local server.

## Additional Configurations

### Using Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add necessary variables:
```sh
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```
Access them in React components via:
```js
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
```

### Linting and Formatting
To check for linting errors:
```sh
npm run lint
```
To format code:
```sh
npm run format
```

### Deploying the App
- Ensure you have run `npm run build`.
- Deploy the `dist/` folder to a static hosting provider like **Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages**.

## Troubleshooting
- If dependencies fail, try:
  ```sh
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install
  ```
- Ensure `vite.config.ts` is correctly set up.
- Check the console logs for errors and missing environment variables.
